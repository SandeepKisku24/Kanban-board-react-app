In this web development project I have fetched data using an api. The data contians tasks along with certain parameters. The parameters include: 
1) name of person doing the task
2) the status of the task
3) the priority of the task
Using the above data I have made a UI using which a user can see the data in a comprenable manner. The user can group the data on the basis of users,priority and status.
